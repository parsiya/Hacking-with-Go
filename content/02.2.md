## For
Similar to C with two differences:

- No parenthesis around the three components. Having parenthesis will give result in an error.
- Curly braces `{ }` are always required and the first one needs to be in the same line as for, if, etc.

It has three components:

- `for init; condition; post { }`

``` go
// 02.2-01-for1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
        sum += i
    }

    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

Init and post (first and last) components are optional and turn `for` into `while`:

``` go
// 02.2-02-for2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum, i := 0
    for i < 20 { // while (i<20)
        sum += i
        i++
    }

    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

Without the condition it turns into `for(;;)` or `while(1)`

``` go
for {   // while(1)
    ...
}
```

## ++ and --
Don't be fooled by their use in `for` examples. According to the [FAQ][faq-incdec], they are "statements" and not "expressions." In other words we can use them to increase or decrease a variable by one but cannot assign the result to a different one.

This will not work:

``` go
// 02.2-03-incdec.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum, i := 0
    // This will not work
    sum = i++
    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

```

.\02.2-03-incdec.go:9:9: syntax error: unexpected ++ at end of statement
```

<a name="if"></a>
## if
Does not need parenthesis but needs curly braces.


``` go
// 02.2-04-if1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    a := 10
    b := 20

    if b > a {
        fmt.Println(b, ">", a)
    }
}
```

<a name="short-statements"></a>
## Short statements
Short statements are interesting. They are statements that are executed before the condition. It's not a unique idea to Go because we have already seen them in `for` constructs in almost every language.

They can be used in `if`s.

``` go
// 02.2-05-if2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    if var1 := 20; var1 > 10 {
        fmt.Println("Inside if:", var1)
    }
    // Cannot use the variable var1 here
}
```

In this code `var1 := 20` is executed before the `if` condition. Any variables declared in the short statement are only in scope in the `if` block and are destroyed after.

Short statements are usually used for executing a function and checking the return value with an `if`.

<a name="else"></a>
## else
`else` is similar to C else.

If the corresponding `if` has a short statement then any variables declared in the short statement are also in scope in the `else` block.


``` go
// 02.2-06-else.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    if var1 := 20; var1 > 100 {
        fmt.Println("Inside if:", var1)
    } else {
        // Can use var1 here
        fmt.Println("Inside else:", var1)
    }
    // Cannot use var1 here
}
```

<a name="switch"></a>
## switch
Similar to C switch with some differences:

- Doesn't automatically go to the next `switch` statement unless you have `fallthrough` in the end. The `fallthrough` only works if it's the last statement in the case.
- Can have a short statement like `if`.

``` go
// 02.2-07-switch1.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    switch num := rand.Intn(3); num {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("1")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("2")
    default:
        fmt.Println("3")
    }
}
```

Cases can have `if` conditions if we use a switch with an empty value:

``` go
// 02.2-08-switch2.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    switch num := rand.Intn(100); {
    case num < 50:
        fmt.Println("Less than 50")
    default:
        fmt.Println("More than 50")
    }
}
```

The short statement does not have to be part of the switch:


``` go
// 02.2-09-switch3.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    num := rand.Intn(100)
    switch {
    case num < 50:
        fmt.Println("Less than 50")
    default:
        fmt.Println("More than 50")
    }
}
```

<a name="defer"></a>
## defer
`defer` is another interesting feature in Go. It defers the execution of a function until the calling function returns.

It works like a stack, every time program reaches a `defer`, it will push that function with its argument values. When surrounding function returns, deferred functions are popped from the stack and executed.

``` go
// 02.2-10-defer1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("This runs after main")

    fmt.Println("Main ended")
}
```

Results in:

```
Z:\Go\src\Hacking-with-Go\code\02>go run 02.2-10-defer1.go
Main ended
This runs after main
```

Argument values are saved when the `defer` statement is reached but it is executed later.

``` go
// 02.2-11-defer2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 1
    defer fmt.Println("After main returns", num)

    num++
    fmt.Println("Inside main", num)
}
```

The value of `num` was `1` when the print was deferred.
