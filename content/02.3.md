## Pointers
Similar to C:

- Point with `*`: `var p *int` == `int *p;`
- Generate pointer (get address of) with `&`: `i := 1` and `p = &i`

**No pointer arithmetic.**

<a name="structs"></a>
## Structs
Go does not have classes. It has structs like C.

Exported field names need to be uppercase to be visible outside the defining package.

``` go
// 02-18-structs.go
package main

import "fmt"

type Student struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
}

func main() {
    // Make an instance
    studentOne := Student{"Ender", "Wiggin"}

    // Now we can access fields
    fmt.Println(studentOne.FirstName)

    // We can just assign fields using names, anything not assigned will be
    // initialized with "zero" as we have seen before
    studentTwo := Student{FirstName: "Petra"}

    // We will print "{Petra }" notice the space after Petra which is supposed
    // to be the delimiter between the fields, LastName is nil because it is not
    // given a value
    fmt.Println(studentTwo)

    // Can also make a pointer to a struct
    p := &studentOne

    // Now instead of *p.LastName (doesn't work) we can just use p.LastName
    // fmt.Println((*p).LastName) will not work with error message: invalid indirect of p (type Student)
    fmt.Println(p.LastName)

    // Which is the same as
    fmt.Println(studentOne.LastName)

    // We can just create a pointer out of the blue
    p2 := &Student{"Hercule", "Poirot"}
    fmt.Println(p2)
}
```

Tour of Go says, we have to create a pointer to a struct to access fields while we can just do it directly as we saw in the code.

<a name="arrays"></a>
## Arrays

`var a [10]int` == `int a[10];`.

**Arrays cannot be resized.**

``` go
// 02-19-array.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    var a [5]int
    a[0] = 10
    a[4] = 20

    fmt.Println(a) // [10 0 0 0 20]

    // Array can be initialized during creation
    // characters[2] is empty
    characters := [3]string{"Ender", "Pentra"}

    fmt.Println(characters) // [Ender Pentra ]
}
```

<a name="slices"></a>
## Slices
Slice is a dynamic view of an array. Slices _don't store anything_ by themselves, they reference an array. If we change something via the slice, the array is modified.

Think of slices as dynamic arrays. When a slice is created out of the blue, an underlying array is also initialized and can be modified by the slice.

``` go
// 02-20-slice1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Create an array of strings with 3 members
    characters := [3]string{"Ender", "Petra", "Mazer"}

    // Last index is exclusive
    // allMembers []string := characters[0:3]
    var allMembers []string = characters[0:3]
    fmt.Println("All members", allMembers)

    var lastTwo []string = characters[1:3]
    fmt.Println("Last two members", lastTwo)

    // Replace Mazer with Bean
    fmt.Println("Replacing Mazer with Bean")
    allMembers[2] = "Bean"

    fmt.Println("All members after Bean swap", characters)

    fmt.Println("Last two members after Bean swap", lastTwo)
}
```

We can create array and slice literals. Meaning we can just initialize them by their members instead of assigning a length and then add more members. If a slice literal is created, the underlying array is also created.

``` go
// 02-21-slice2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Slice literal of type struct, the underlying array is created automatically
    sliceStruct := []struct {
        a, b int
    }{
        {1, 2},
        {3, 4},
        {5, 6}, // need this comma in the end otherwise it will not work
    }

    fmt.Println(sliceStruct)
}
```

If a length is not specified during array creation, the result is a slice literal as seen above.

If we do not want to specify a length we can use `[...]`.

``` go
// 02-22-slice3.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    characters := [...]string{"Ender", "Petra", "Mazer"}

    fmt.Println(characters)
}
```

<a name="slice-length-and-capacity"></a>
### Slice length and capacity
Slices have length and capacity.

- **Length** is the current number of items in the slice. Returned by `len(slice)`.
- **Capacity** is the maximum number of items in the slice. Returned by `cap(slice)`. Capacity is determined by the number of items in the original array from the start of the slice and *not the size of array*. For example if the slice starts from the second item (index 1) of an array, slice capacity is `len(array)-1`. This ensures that the slice cannot go past the array.

**In most cases, we do not care about capacity. Create slices and append to them.**

``` go
// 02-23-slice4.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    ints := [...]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println(ints)

    slice1 := ints[2:6]

    // len=4 and cap=4 (from 3rd item of the array until the end)
    printSlice(slice1)

    slice1 = ints[2:4]

    // len=2 but cap will remain 4
    printSlice(slice1)
}

// Copied from the tour
func printSlice(s []int) {
    fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
```

<a name="make"></a>
### make
To create dynamically-sized arrays use `make`. `make` creates a zero-ed array and returns a slice pointing to it.

- `slice1 := make([]int, 10)` creates an int array of length 10.
- `slice2 := make([]int, 5, 10)` creates an int array of length 5 and capacity of 10.

We can **append** stuff to slices and it grows as needed:

- `slice1 = append(slice1, 1)`
 
We can append multiple elements:

- `slice1 = append(slice1, 1, 2, 3)`

<a name="append"></a>
### append
In order to append one slice to another (obviously they should be of the same type), we have to use `...` as follows:

- `slice1 = append(slice1, slice2...)`

`append` is a variadic function, meaning it can an arbitrary number of arguments. By passing `slice2...`, we are essentially passing each member of `slice2` one by one to `append`.

**This is pretty useful later on when we want to append two byte slices together.**

``` go
// 02-24-slice-append.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Create a slice pointing to an int array
    s1 := make([]int, 5)

    fmt.Println(s1) // [0 0 0 0 0]

    for i := 0; i < len(s1); i++ {
        s1[i] = i
    }

    fmt.Println(s1) // [0 1 2 3 4]

    s2 := make([]int, 3)

    for i := 0; i < len(s2); i++ {
        s2[i] = i
    }

    fmt.Println(s2) // [0 1 2]

    s3 := append(s1, s2...)

    fmt.Println(s3) // [0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2]
}
```

<a name="range"></a>
## range
`range` iterates over slices. It returns an index and *a copy of the item* stored at that index.

- `for index, value := range slice`

`value` is optional but `index` is not. Ignore either with `_`.

``` go
// 02-25-range.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    characters := [3]string{"Ender", "Petra", "Mazer"}
    for i, v := range characters {
        fmt.Println(i, v)
    }

    // 0 Ender
    // 1 Petra
    // 2 Mazer

    fmt.Println("-----------")

    // Only using index
    for i := range characters {
        fmt.Println(i, characters[i])
    }

    fmt.Println("-----------")

    // Ignoring index
    for _, v := range characters {
        // No non-elaborate way to get index here
        fmt.Println(v)
    }

    // Ender
    // Petra
    // Mazer
}
```
